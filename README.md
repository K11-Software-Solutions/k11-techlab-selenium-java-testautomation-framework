# 🧱 K11 TechLab – Selenium Java Automation Framework

# 🧰 Getting Started with the Java-Based End-to-End Test Automation Framework

This Java-based test automation framework is designed to support **end-to-end test coverage** across web, API, and database layers, with seamless CI/CD integration and enterprise-grade extensibility.

---

## ✅ Core Features

- **Web UI Testing** using Selenium WebDriver  
- **API Testing** with REST-assured and Java SAAJ for SOAP  
- **Database Validation** via JDBC with SQL/NoSQL utility support  
- **Test Data Management** with Excel, JSON, database queries, and runtime data generation  
- **Dynamic Configuration** using `.properties`, `.yaml`, or `.json` with CLI/CI parameters  
- **Structured Logging & Reporting** with Log4j/SLF4J, ExtentReports, email and screenshot support  
- **CI/CD Ready**: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab, and cloud execution (e.g., Sauce Labs)  

Built entirely with open-source libraries, this framework is **fully extensible**—ready to scale for validations involving files, emails, microservices, or third-party system integrations.

The framework is composed of well-structured layers to ensure **modularity**, **maintainability**, and **scalability** across complex enterprise test environments.

### 1️⃣ Framework Layer – *The Foundation*
- Driver management (Selenium Grid/local/cloud)
- Config loading from external files
- Page Object Model (POM) structure
- Test data provider (Excel/JSON/DB)

### 2️⃣ Utility Classes – *Powering Reusability*
- Wait utilities (explicit/implicit/fluent)
- File, JSON, Excel handlers
- REST & SOAP service clients
- DB interaction (JDBC-based)
- Locator and email utilities

### 3️⃣ Automated Test Suite – *The Execution Brain*
- Test cases built on Base Test structure
- POM-based interactions
- Data-driven via `@DataProvider`
- Configurable execution (env, role, browser)
- Domain-Specific Language (DSL) support for readability

### 4️⃣ Test Execution – *Anywhere, Anytime*
- Run tests locally, via Docker, VMs, or cloud (Sauce Labs, BrowserStack)
- Supports headless execution
- Retry analyzer and failure recovery
- Data cleanup & environment reset utilities

### 5️⃣ CI/CD Integration – *Automating the Pipeline*
- Jenkins / GitHub Actions ready
- Parameterized build support
- Maven-based dependency management
- Artifactory/Nexus for internal libs

### 6️⃣ Error Handling and Recovery Scenarios – *Resilience First*
- Centralized exception handling
- Custom exception types
- Retry mechanism (TestNG-based)
- Safe teardown and recovery logic

### 7️⃣ Logging and Reporting – *Know What Happened, Instantly*
- ExtentReports/Allure HTML reports
- Log4j/SLF4J structured logs
- Screenshot capture on failure
- Email notifications with test summaries

### 8️⃣ Framework Capabilities & Extensibility
- Supports **Web, Mobile, SOAP, REST API** testing
- Dynamic configuration & data handling
- Cloud-ready & DevOps integrated
- Extensible for:
  - File-based validations (local/FTP)
  - Email workflows
  - Microservices architecture
  - Localization, accessibility, performance testing
